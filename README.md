# nuovosalario

website to track and plot the commercial unit advertised prices for the area Rome / Nuovo Salario (Italy). 
the working website can be found here: https://damp-tundra-03130.herokuapp.com/

this is another one of my "study projects".
by doing this website I have learnt:
- how to create Plotly graphs and embed them into a website, using Django
- the graphs are generated "on the fly", which is something I have been trying to figure out from my previous attempt at a django website
- how to create Django ListView and TemplateView
- how to scrape using BeautifulSoup
- how to set up Cron Jobs in Django/Python/Heroku using django-admin commands
